# Java Spring Boot Spreader Application

This project is a **Java Spring Boot application** developed as part of a Udemy course.  
It focuses on building a structured backend application with basic server-side rendering using **Thymeleaf**.

The project follows common Spring Boot best practices and serves as a solid foundation for scalable Java applications.

## 🚀 Tech Stack

- **Java**
- **Spring Boot**
  - Spring Web
  - Spring MVC
- **Thymeleaf**
- **Maven**
- **Embedded Tomcat**

## ✨ Features

- MVC architecture using Spring Boot
- Controllers handling HTTP requests
- Thymeleaf templates for server-side rendered views
- Clean project structure following Spring conventions
- Configuration via `application.properties`

## 🧠 Learning Objectives

Through this project, I practiced and reinforced:

- Spring Boot fundamentals and annotations
- Dependency Injection
- Request mapping and controllers
- Integration of Thymeleaf with backend logic
- Organizing a maintainable Java project
